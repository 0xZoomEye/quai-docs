## Security & Interoperability in Disparate Scaling Topologies by Dr. K

### Published 22 March 2023

With Ethereum adoption the need for scaling solutions to enable high throughput web3 applications is greater than ever. However, current scaling solutions (i.e. optimism, zk-snarks, and rollups) introduce non-obvious security and interoperability challenges that need to be addressed. This talk highlights some of the security and interoperability challenges and proposes a novel mechanism for creating trust-less composable bridges in a multi blockchain environment.
